    "'''Here is the  five key concepts Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is like a recipe or blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "Objects are like real things made from that recipe, and they can have properties (like color, size) and actions (like run, jump).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation means wrapping data (properties) and actions (methods) into a single unit, like a capsule.\n",
    "It also hides some parts so people can only use what’s allowed, making it safer and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is about hiding all the messy details and showing only what’s important.\n",
    "Think of driving a car—you just need to know how to steer and press the pedals; you don’t need to know how the engine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows one class to take on properties and actions from another class, like how a child inherits traits from parents.\n",
    "This helps to avoid rewriting code and keeps things organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many shapes.\" It allows one action to work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
    "For example, the word \"draw\" can mean different things for different objects—a circle and a square would draw themselves in different ways.'''\n"
